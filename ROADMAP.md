## Current Track: Canonical Zephyr Firmware

Goal: keep Zephyr as the canonical firmware architecture while Rust remains
authoritative for compiler, SQBC tooling, and VM semantics.

### 1. Extend Canonical Zephyr Runtime Services

- Activate GPIO-button input bindings in Zephyr and prove `key.SELECT`
  dispatch from the ESP32-C3 BOOT/GPIO9 button when physical button testing is
  possible.
- Decide service priority and target support for currently spec-recognized but
  not SQBC-backed APIs: `httpServer.*`, `bleTransfer.*`, and any remaining
  `content.*` APIs beyond the current file pick/read family. Defer
  `binbook.*` firmware/compiler/FFI work until the e-paper display is available
  and the BinBook spec has settled enough to avoid optimizing around rough
  draft behavior. Add each remaining API only as a real compiler/SQBC/VM/Zephyr
  slice with honest unsupported behavior until then.
- Design app-entry versus import-only source semantics before adding real
  include/import expansion. Only an app entry file should become an app;
  include/import files should be reusable declarations and should not synthesize
  screens by themselves. Use that design pass to settle related module
  questions such as symbol namespacing, declaration override rules,
  package/import versioning, duplicate declarations across files, and what
  app-lifecycle declarations are legal in import-only files.
- Add external Wi-Fi AP client association/DHCP lease proof through
  Zephyr-native subsystems.
- Decide whether the ESP32-C3 Super Mini reference target should expose
  `bleTransfer.*`; if yes, implement and verify it through Zephyr BLE instead
  of relying on MCU radio metadata alone.
- Extend the `app.triggers` model beyond current timer metadata declarations to
  future logical button/input triggers while keeping `event.on(...)` as the
  handler for the activation event that fires later.
- Add a generic PWM-capable LED-like device output model beyond
  `service.indicator`, so future target-described GPIO/PWM endpoints can expose
  smooth brightness control without board-specific app code.
- Support multiple `use` entries for one logical indicator when an app
  intentionally wants `service.indicator.write(...)` to drive more than one
  physical output.
- Reduce ESP32-C3 Zephyr RAM as canonical firmware hardening. Identify concrete
  reductions for the largest static allocations, especially VM runtime storage,
  work stacks, response/session buffers, logging, LittleFS pools, and file
  caches.
- Improve network heap attribution before expanding Wi-Fi scope. Current AP
  start/stop hardware coverage drives `ram_heap_max_allocated_bytes` close to
  the 36 KiB system heap budget; add clearer per-workload heap reset or
  attribution before TCP, AP client throughput, BLE coexistence, or larger
  network workloads.
- Add a hardware VM lazy-load screen transition benchmark. Install an app with
  about 10 small screens, repeatedly switch screen-to-screen from LittleFS, and
  report VM-only transition timing from event dispatch through lazy SQBC
  read/resume and draw-log callback completion, excluding host serial latency
  and physical display refresh. Include SQBC read count/bytes and
  min/median/p95/max timing over repeated transitions.
- Audit remaining firmware, FFI, protocol, and hardware-helper fixed buffers;
  replace accidental stack or harness buffers with caller-owned, borrowed,
  streaming, file-backed, or VM-owned storage where practical.
